In this tutorial, we’ll discuss our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our custom face mask detector.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

  1.  Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
  2.  Detect face masks in real-time video streams
